# Preface

This is the Repository for a Magnetic Case family for the Corne keyboard. There are 5 different version, so its easy to lose track of all the different versions or even to find the rigth one for your Corne and intented use case. So here is a overview with a quick summary of the features of the different cases and links to the different repositories.

# Mcorne Legacy
![Mcorne_legacy](https://github.com/Runningtarrens/Mcorne-overview/blob/main/pictures/20211104_104911.jpg)


This is the first version of the Mcorne line up. It was made for easy access to the pcb without the need of removing any screws. It supports two tenting methodes. You can use the tenting holes, with screws or stand-offs or use the magnetic tenting. For the magnetic tenting there are magnets in the bottom of the case. This is the only case with tenting holes. Its the hardest print, because the egde of the case is so small that the tolerances for the magnet-pockets are very slim. This could result it a very hard time getting the magnets in or the pockets bulging outwards. Also the magnets used in this version are hard to find. People reported that they couldnt find the magnets anywhere. It needs 14x4x2.5mm magnets. So be aware and check local availability first. Another point that makes it hard to print is the lower edge of the case, it has a champfer on it. That creats a really nice look but its not optimal for printing because that increases the chance of warping. You need good bed adhesion.


# Mcorne Armor
![Mcorne_Armor](https://github.com/Runningtarrens/Mcorne-overview/blob/main/pictures/20220505_142000.jpg)

This is an updated version of the legacy case. It uses the same sized magnets but now has extented pockets for them, which makes the process simple and produces less problems with tolerances. The tenting holes got removed and the champfer on the bottom of the case got replace with a widened base to decerease the chance of warping even more. That are optimizations to make the process simpler. But because of those changes the case looks more rugged. So the top champfar was changed to point inward and with the right print settings the outside of the case gets a slight rough texture. Thats how it came to its name Armor.



# Mcorne Modulus
![Mcorne_Modulus](https://github.com/Runningtarrens/Mcorne-overview/blob/main/pictures/20221020_153903.jpg)

The Modulus was a from the bottom up new design. It uses different sized magnets that are simpler to source. This allows smaller bezels/ no bulges like the Armor. To make this Case modular, it got spilt into 3 parts instead of the typical 2 parts. Bottom, Top and Edge. The case is usabale with only the bottom and top part. The egde makes it a high edge case. That allows for some variation of the case. Use it as a low edge case( see the switches), high edge case with outwards or inwards champfer for different looks and with the ability to have utilities included in the egde part. For example a 40mm trackpad holder. This allows the case to be truly modular and add parts later to it without reprinting the whole case. Because if the 3 part setup of the case, it has a very distinct look to it. It has a slot on the side where the MCU is sitting.


# Mcorne choc
![Mcorne_Choc](https://github.com/Runningtarrens/Mcorne-overview/blob/main/pictures/20220930_104928.jpg)

This is a low profile case for the choc version of the corne. It is for only 5 columns with a 6 column version coming later too. Its made for wireless( but might work with a wired version as well, depending on the hight of the TRRS port). The case is a low edge version because there is no need of a high edge to hide the switches. Its suppost to be used with the battery stached under the MCU. the bottom case is to low to hide the battery in there. It also uses the small magnets as the Modulus.


# Mcorne c5
![Mcorne_c5](https://github.com/Runningtarrens/Mcorne-overview/blob/main/pictures/20221110_092837.jpg)

The c5 is a MX case for 5 columns. It was designed for wireless use with the new (still experimental) ultralight PCBs from [Pete johanson.](https://github.com/petejohanson/crkbd/tree/board/corne-ultralight "Corne Ultralight") It has no port for the TRRS connector only a little slot for the power button. The bottom part was designed that the battery can be stored in it instead of the usual place under the MCU. That will allow to but bigger batteries in the bottom as well. Also it has enough clearance to have the JST connector for the battery on the undersite of the pcb, allowing a super clean setup. That comes at a cost, the case is not as flat as the choc version. The c5 is the only case that uses different tenting feet that can be attached to the case for transport( as seen on the image).
